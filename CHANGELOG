This is a list of differences to the last release.

0.2:
	- MSVC fixes
	- Made the server optional (use the cmake variable ENABLE_SERVER to control if it's built)
	- Added source groups (again, MSVC stuff)
	- Added a "quick log" at the top left
	- Moved the cursor to the top right
	- Screenshots are now saved in a "screenshots" directory
	- Desaturation is now controlled by the loading progress
