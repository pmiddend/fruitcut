fruitcut Introductory Information
=================================

Fruitcut was inspired by the very popular game Fruit Ninja by Halfbrick
Studios. At random points in time, fruits are spawned and appear on the screen.
It's your goal to cut them and earn points. Of course, you get bonuses (called
"bonsu" in the game) if you're fast at cutting, or fulfill special conditions.
